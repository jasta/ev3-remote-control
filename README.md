ev3dev is a great platform but it lacks an intuitive way to prototype that's
novice and kid friendly.  The factory ev3 software includes a rudimentary
sensor/actuator view on the screen but it's very difficult to read and hard to
use in advanced situations.  Likewise other apps on the market to interface via
Bluetooth are very crude and are limited in terms of range of possible use
cases and information available (e.g. sensors are not usually available).
